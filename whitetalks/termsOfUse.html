                        <li style="text-decoration:underline;padding:0.75em 0px"> 	Membership and Required Information </li>

                        In addition to the above opportunities, WT membership automatically makes you a part of the WT Panel, a health care professional survey panel own and maintained by WT (“Panel”). As a Panel member, you will have access to the below services as well as eligibility to receive invitations to participate in market research surveys in the event such opportunities arise. Participation in the Panel is free of cost. As a Panel member, WT (or its service providers or affiliates on WT's behalf) may contact you multiple times via any or all contact information provided by you to WT.
                        You may only join WT once and therefore membership is personal to you and is not transferable to any other person. WT has the right to refuse any WT member inclusion in market research Panels.
                        To complete your Panel profile, you will be asked to provide information on key profiling demographics that we need, at a minimum, to ensure you are eligible to become a member of the Panel and to ensure that once you have successfully registered with the Panel that you have every opportunity to be invited to the surveys as may be applicable. You are responsible for ensuring that your personal details and your profile data at any point are true, accurate and current. Providing additional information as part of your profile, which is accessible on your personal member page is not required but may further increase your chances of being invited to surveys relevant to you.

                        <li style="text-decoration:underline;padding:0.75em 0px"> 	Login Credentials </li>

                        It remains your responsibility to ensure your login credentials (e-mail address and password) are kept confidential. WT will not be liable for any unauthorized use of your account which includes unauthorized use of your email address and password.
                        <li style="text-decoration:underline;padding:0.75em 0px"> 	Removal from Panel </li>

                        If you no longer wish to be a member of the Panel, you may request to be removed from the Panel at any time. If you choose to opt-out of the Panel, you will terminate your WT membership and you forfeit any right to any honoraria or incentives not yet reimbursed to you.
                        You can request your personal details to be removed from the Panel active database and to have your participation in the Panel terminated by:

                        Failure to follow the stated procedure correctly may result in delay in the removal of your information from the Panel databases. Your removal request will be dealt with promptly. However, there may be a gap of up to 1 month between your request to be removed and the cessation of the receipt of any further e-mails from WT.
                        <li style="text-decoration:underline;padding:0.75em 0px"> 	Termination of Panel Participation </li>

                            WT and its clients may present you with opportunities (“<b>Opportunities</b>”) for interaction with WT and its clients. Participation in Opportunities may include interactions on third party websites. You may be offered compensation for participation in certain Opportunities. Your completion of such an Opportunity does not constitute confirmation of WT's obligation to compensate you for such participation. Compensation for such Opportunities shall require that you are automatically returned to the WT Site upon completion of such Opportunity and receive a confirmation message on the Site. No payments shall be made by WT without your receipt of such confirmation page. The value of an Opportunity is subject to change at any time without notice. The criteria by which an Opportunity becomes eligible for payment is subject to change at any time. WT reserves the right at any time to withhold or cancel any of your payments or fees due for any reason including any actions or omissions on your part that are not completed, unauthorized, fraudulent or otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement.
                            <b><li style ="padding:0.5em 0px"> Earning </li> </b>
                            Should you participate as a Panel member to respond to surveys or other Opportunities as contemplated above, you may be entitled to honoraria or incentives for completed participation, depending upon the specifics of the survey or response opportunity. The value of your honorarium or incentive, communicated to you prior to survey participation, is dependent on multiple factors, such as the length of the survey and the complexity of the research project, the type of survey and related service, and any local regulations in your jurisdiction.
                            The WT Balance program allows you to hold your honorarium in a WT maintained account (“<b>WT Balance</b>”). Upon completion of a survey or response opportunity for which you are entitled to an honorarium or incentive, the funds will be transferred to your WT Balance.
                            You will be able to either hold your honoraria or incentive in your WT Balance or choose to withdraw part or the totality of your balance by selecting an incentive type for the withdrawal. You will get to make the choice every time you access your WT Balance.
                            <b><li style ="padding:0.5em 0px">Withdraw </li></b>
                            The honoraria and incentives that you earn are accumulated until withdrawn via your active account. In order to withdraw your honoraria, you must select "Withdraw" from the "Earnings Summary" page. All or some of your balance can be withdrawn to be issued using a number of methods as set forth on the "Earnings Summary" page, which may include such options as prepaid debit card, gift card, check, or donation to charity (not tax-deductible). WT reserves the right to substitute any honoraria or incentive for a reward of equivalent value or higher value if the applicable honoraria or incentive is not available for an unacceptable amount of time. If you have any issues with selecting payment, please contact us at support@WT.com.
                            Cheque or debit card payments are to be made to the individual WT balance account owner, as held on file by WT.
                            You are responsible for the confidentiality of your account information as further set forth below. If a third party uses your account to withdraw your balance without your consent, WT has no liability for refunding or replenishing your balance.
                        </ol>
                    </ol>
                    <b><li style="padding:0.75em 0px"> Information Sharing and Third Parties  </li></b>

                    WT reserves the right to appoint third party processors to process and administer any honoraria or incentives.
