		This is an HTML table with <input> elements that allow the user to enter data
		and <span> elements in which the program can display its results.
		These elements have ids like "interest" and "years". These ids are used
		in the JavaScript code that follows the table. Note that some of the input
		elements define "onchange" or "onclick" event handlers. These specify strings
		of JavaScript code to be executed when the user enters data or clicks.
