				<h1>Fix - Fee Divorce</h1>
				<em>Making the law simpler for you.</em>

			<p class="descriptive-para">
				<strong>How it works</strong>
				To help you with your divorce and to budget effectively we have developed a fixed fee scheme. This will ensure you know exactly what you are paying for and what it will cost. Where appropriate we can conduct your case under one or a series of fixed prices. You can choose what aspects you want us to deal with. Fixed fees are not appropriate for every client and you may prefer our hourly rate package. Below is our fixed fee menu.
				<span>All prices include VAT but there may be additional court fees.</span>

				<h3>What is not included</h3>
				<p>These fixed  costs do not cover negotiations relating to finances or children and if these issues arise then we will discuss further costs with you as a fixed fee is not likely to be appropriate at that stage.<br><br>You can always opt for our full package which is on an hourly rate if there are complex issues arising or if you have chosen a fixed package at the outset then you can change package at any time. Simple ask a member of the team.</p>
